Today, the initial version of the ~~Jekyll Documentation Theme~~ **Gerbera Theme** was checked into GitHub. It borrows heavily from the stylesheets used by [Facebook's GraphQL documentation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql.github.io).

This theme represents the first time that I've used Jekyll. I would like to create some static documentation for some open source projects that I plan to release on GitHub, and discovered Jekyll it via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
