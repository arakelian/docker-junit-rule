After a few evenings of work, I'm comfortable enough with [Gerbera](https://github.com/arakelian/jekyll-theme-gerbera) to publish the [example site](https://github.com/arakelian/jekyll-theme-gerbera/tree/master/example) via GitHub pages. That's what you're reading right now!

To run this website locally, download this project and use the `preview.sh` script that exists in the root of the project.
