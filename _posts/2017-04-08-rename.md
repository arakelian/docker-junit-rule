title: Why Gerbera?
---

Originally, this project was called "Jekyll Documentation Theme". 

I thought it would be more fun to give it unique name, so I went to Flickr and searched for the word "pink". Although the dominant color used by this theme is
actually [Pantone Rhodamine Red C](https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/Rhodamine-Red-C), "pink" was close enough! 

I quickly came across a [beautiful photo](https://flic.kr/p/58jwXx) of a Gerbera
by [Swaminathan](https://www.flickr.com/photos/araswami/), and decided that I would name the project after this beautiful flower. Fortunately the photo itself
was licensed under the Creative Commons License, so also adapted it for use
on the [landing page](http://www.arakelian.com/jekyll-theme-gerbera/).
